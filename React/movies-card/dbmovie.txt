The reasons for his brother leaving the island is known to him only through rumours, as to something to do with a broken heart. He has almost forgotten the elder one's face. Even the photographs he have of him are unclear. About his life in Mumbai too, Mulla has heard only rumours. Mulla asks his uncle and current guardian Moosa (Dileesh Pothan) - 'Are these stories about him true?'. At this point, we are not told about what he has heard."
