        <center><b><em>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.<br> It has been adapted from a number of
                    different recipes
                    that I have read over the years.<br>
                    is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with
                    salad,
                    grilled meats and pitta breads.</em></b></center>
